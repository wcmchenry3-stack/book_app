"""Background task: periodically delete expired refresh tokens.

Expired tokens (expires_at < now) can never be used regardless of their
revocation status, so they are safe to remove.  Keeping them indefinitely
causes unbounded table growth and slows the JTI revocation lookup index.

The task runs once at startup (with an initial delay) then every 24 hours.
It is launched inside the FastAPI lifespan and cancelled on shutdown.
