"""Magic bytes validation for uploaded image files.

Extension and Content-Type headers are both client-supplied and can be spoofed.
This module verifies that the actual file content matches the declared format,
catching polyglot files and content/extension mismatches before bytes are
forwarded to downstream services (e.g. OpenAI Vision API).

Note on EXIF/metadata: images from mobile cameras may embed GPS coordinates and
other metadata. Since uploaded bytes are forwarded directly to OpenAI and never
stored on disk, this is a user privacy consideration rather than a server
vulnerability. Strip EXIF via pillow if the app ever persists images.
