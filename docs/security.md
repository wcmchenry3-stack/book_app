# Security

See [~/.claude/standards/security.md](~/.claude/standards/security.md) for universal security standards.

**Related docs:** [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#middleware-stack) (middleware stack + rate limiting) · [`integrations.md`](integrations.md#cloudflare) (Turnstile + WAF) · [`api.md`](api.md#conventions) (error response format) · [`data-model.md`](data-model.md#refresh_tokens-backendappmodelsrefresh_tokenpy) (JTI revocation table)

## Security Controls

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| JWT algorithm confusion | Pinned to RS256; all other algorithms including `none` rejected |
| JWT expiry | 24hr access token, 7-day refresh token with JTI revocation |
| Refresh token theft | Single-use rotation — every `/auth/refresh` revokes the old `jti` and issues a new one |
| Single-user lock | `ALLOWED_EMAILS` env var checked post-Google-auth |
| Rate limiting | `slowapi` — per-client-IP; 10 req/min on `/scan`, 5/min auth, 120/min reads, etc. |
| Real client IP | `CloudflareRealIPMiddleware` reads `CF-Connecting-IP` in production |
| Host header spoofing | `TrustedHostMiddleware` (prod only) rejects requests with Host header outside `TRUSTED_HOSTS`; `/health` exempted via `_HealthExemptTrustedHost` so origin-direct probes still work |
| Request size limit | `RequestSizeLimitMiddleware` drops bodies > 10 MB with 413 before reading the stream |
| DDoS / Bot protection | Cloudflare free tier (Bot Fight Mode, HTTP DDoS protection) |
| Bot protection on /scan | Cloudflare Turnstile — opt-in via `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` env var. Request must carry `cf-turnstile-response`; verified against Cloudflare siteverify with 5s timeout |
| CORS | Explicit method/header allowlist; wildcard origins rejected at config validation |
| Input validation | Pydantic on all endpoints; extension + MIME + size + magic bytes on uploads |
| SQL injection | SQLAlchemy ORM throughout; no raw SQL |
| HTTPS | Render TLS termination; HSTS header (production); Cloudflare Full-strict TLS |
| Secret scanning | `gitleaks` pre-commit hook + GitHub Secret Scanning |
| Dependency CVEs | Dependabot + `pip-audit` + `npm audit` + Trivy (OSV+NVD) in CI |
| SAST | Bandit (Python) — HIGH/MEDIUM findings block CI |
| DAST | OWASP ZAP active scan (weekly + manual dispatch) |
| CI supply chain | All reusable workflow refs pinned to commit SHA |
| Web token storage | In-memory `Map` (never `localStorage`); native uses `SecureStore` |
| Security headers | CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy |
| Error disclosure | Exception messages stripped from HTTP error responses; logged server-side only |

## Pre-commit Hook (gitleaks)

Install: `brew install gitleaks` (or via pip on Windows)

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
gitleaks protect --staged --redact
```

## Penetration Testing Runbook

### Authorization

This is a personal application. The authorized tester is the repository owner.
All testing must be performed against:
- Staging/dev deployment **or** a dedicated test account on production
- Never against real user data

Create a dedicated test account: sign in with a Google account used only for testing.

### Tools

```bash
pip install jwt_tool        # JWT algorithm confusion, tampering
pip install pip-audit       # Python dependency CVE scan
npm install -g npm-check    # Dependency freshness
# Burp Suite Community (manual HTTP manipulation)
# ffuf (endpoint fuzzing)
```

### Cadence

| Frequency | What |
|-----------|------|
| Every CI run | Bandit, pip-audit, npm audit, Trivy |
| Weekly (automated) | OWASP ZAP active scan (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) |
| Quarterly (manual) | Full OWASP Top 10 checklist below |
| Every dep bump | `pip-audit -r backend/requirements.txt` locally before merging |

### OWASP Top 10 Manual Checklist

Run quarterly. Check each item off and record date + tester.

**A01 — Broken Access Control**
- [ ] Access user A's `user_book_id` as user B → expect 404 (ownership scoped via `_user_book_query(current_user.id)`)
- [ ] UUID enumeration on `GET /user-books/{id}` → always 404, never 403
- [ ] Confirm `GET /auth/me` returns only the current user — no `user_id` override accepted

**A02 — Cryptographic Failures**
- [ ] HSTS header present: `curl -I https://bookshelfapi.buffingchi.com/health`
- [ ] Token algorithm: `base64 -d <<< <header_b64>` → must show `"alg":"RS256"`
- [ ] Refresh token used as access token to `GET /auth/me` → 401

**A03 — Injection**
- [ ] `GET /books/search?q=' OR 1=1--` → 200 with normal results or 422, never 500 DB error
- [ ] Notes field XSS: PATCH `notes: "<script>alert(1)</script>"` → stored as plain text, React Native never renders as HTML
- [ ] Scan filename path traversal: `../../../../etc/passwd.jpg` → `rsplit(".", 1)[-1]` yields `"jpg"`, passes; magic bytes check validates content

**A05 — Security Misconfiguration**
- [ ] `/docs` returns 404 in production
- [ ] All required headers present: `curl -I https://bookshelfapi.buffingchi.com/health | grep -E "x-frame|csp|hsts|permissions"`
- [ ] CORS rejects `Origin: https://evil.example.com`

**A07 — Identification and Authentication Failures**
See "Auth Bypass Test Cases" section below.

**A08 — Software and Data Integrity**
- [ ] CI workflow refs use commit SHAs: `grep -r "@main" .github/workflows/` → empty
- [ ] Magic bytes check catches polyglot: submit JPEG magic + PHP body → forwarded to OpenAI (bytes never executed server-side; acceptable)

**A10 — SSRF**
- [ ] All outbound URLs are hardcoded constants (Google Books, Open Library, JWKS, OpenAI, Turnstile) — no user-supplied URL parameter accepted anywhere

### Auth Bypass Test Cases

Install: `pip install jwt_tool`

```bash
# 1. Algorithm confusion: RS256 → HS256 using public key as HMAC secret
jwt_tool <valid_access_token> -X a -pk public_key.pem
# Submit to GET /auth/me → expect 401

# 2. None algorithm
jwt_tool <valid_access_token> -X n
# Submit to GET /auth/me → expect 401

# 3. JTI replay: use same refresh token twice
# First call rotates the token; second call must return 401
curl -X POST /auth/refresh -d '{"refresh_token":"<old_rt>"}' → 200
curl -X POST /auth/refresh -d '{"refresh_token":"<old_rt>"}' → 401

# 4. Expired token
jwt_tool <valid_access_token> -T   # tamper exp to past
# Submit to GET /auth/me → expect 401

# 5. Token type confusion: submit refresh token to access-only endpoint
# Extract refresh token from storage, submit as Authorization: Bearer to GET /auth/me → 401
```

---

### Rate Limit Bypass Test Cases

```python
import requests, time

BASE = "https://bookshelfapi.buffingchi.com"
TOKEN = "<your_access_token>"

# Authenticated exhaustion — rate_limit_reads = 120/minute
# expect 429 on request 121
for i in range(130):
    r = requests.get(f"{BASE}/user-books", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"})
    print(i, r.status_code)
    if r.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit hit at request", i)
        break

# Auth burst — rate_limit_auth = 5/minute
# expect 429 on request 6
for i in range(10):
    r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/auth/google", json={"id_token": "bad"})
    print(i, r.status_code)
```

**Known limitation:** Rate limits use in-memory storage (no Redis). Limits reset on uvicorn process restart. Acceptable for current personal-app scale.

### File Upload Fuzzing (Burp Repeater)

| Test | Expected result |
|------|----------------|
| JPEG magic + PHP body (polyglot) | Passes magic bytes; forwarded to OpenAI — bytes never executed server-side |
| `Content-Type: image/gif` with valid JPEG body | Passes MIME check, fails magic bytes → 415 |
| `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` | Fails MIME check immediately → 415 |
| Filename `../../../../etc/passwd.jpg` | Extension `"jpg"` extracted via `rsplit(".", 1)[-1]`; magic bytes validated |
| No extension: `filename: "file"` | `"." in filename` is False → 415 |
| File exactly 5 MB | Should pass |
| File 5 MB + 1 byte | 413 |

### ZAP Baseline Promotion Checklist

To promote `fail_action: false` → `fail_action: true` in `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

1. Run scan via `workflow_dispatch` on `security.yml`
2. Download `zap-full-scan-report` artifact from GitHub Actions
3. For each finding:
   - **True positive, fixable** → fix it, re-run
   - **True positive, accepted risk** → add `WARN` rule to `.zap/rules.tsv` with justification
   - **False positive** → add `IGNORE` rule to `.zap/rules.tsv` with explanation
4. When a clean run shows zero `FAIL`-level findings:
   - Change `fail_action: false` → `fail_action: true`
   - Change `cmd_options: '-z "-config scanner.attackStrength=LOW"'` → `MEDIUM`

### Incident Response Quick Reference

**Contain auth abuse immediately:**
```bash
# Activate email allowlist in Render env vars (blocks all non-listed sign-ins)
# ALLOWED_EMAILS=your@email.com
# Triggers re-deploy (~1-2 min)
```

**Revoke a specific user's sessions:**
```sql
UPDATE refresh_tokens
SET revoked_at = NOW()
WHERE user_id = '<uuid>' AND revoked_at IS NULL;
```

**Contain scan abuse:**
```bash
# Lower RATE_LIMIT_SCAN in Render env vars (e.g., "2/minute")
# OR set TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY to activate bot challenge
```

**Post-incident:**
1. Export Render logs for the incident window
2. Check `users`, `user_books`, `refresh_tokens` for unexpected records
3. Run ZAP scan via `workflow_dispatch` post-fix
4. Update this doc if the incident reveals a new threat model
